#Scaffolds

This repo is a starting point for new projects. It contains conventions we use in the form of file/folder names and contents.

TODO: Currently it is only a generic Node.js project scaffold. Consider making a hierarchical branch structure for different kinds of node projects and/or non-node scaffolds.

TODO: consider a script that makes all the project-specific replacements (e.g. name, author), removes .git and possibly even sets up a new one, then deletes itself when done
