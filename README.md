#Scaffolds

This repo is a starting point for new projects. It contains conventions we use in the form of file/folder names and contents.

If you're updating the scaffold itself, treat this like a normal repo.

If you're using this project to begin a new project, begin by running:
```
./init.sh newProjectName
```

TODO: Currently it is only a generic Node.js project scaffold. Consider making a hierarchical branch structure for different kinds of node projects and/or non-node scaffolds.
